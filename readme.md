(Disclaimer: The code is published as is. It is not nice and full of bugs. Enyoy.)

### How to run in dev mode

 2. Optionally you can show the game progress to others: http://localhost:3000/monitor on as many screens as needed
 3. There is a remote controll for *game resets*, *picking quests* etc. http://localhost:3000/controller
